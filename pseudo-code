- A user will click the generate password button and this will need to trigger prompts
- A prompt will ask the desired length of password between 8 - 128 characters
    - This will be validated and rejected if it is less than 8 or more than 128 characters
- A prompt will ask whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
    - They need to choose at least one of these or start over
- The answers to each prompt should be stored as a variable
- There will be variables for all of the different letter/symbol choices that we will pull from
- Depending on answers to the prompt, we will either add or leave off numbers, symbols, etc.
- Use a for loop and generate random numbers to index our large array and pick out charcters for the password.
- Dislpay the password in the box
